### CPSC 120
* Lab 10 
    Lab 10 part 1 had us create a code that could calculate the area of a rectangle. I enjoy 
    doing projects like these because we can put in the numbers and it can calculate the 
    work for us, just like a calculator. This reminds me of a project I did myself where I 
    learned how to code a calcultor.
* Lab 8
    Lab 8 part 1 was to create a pattern with loops. I found this lab interesting because
    we learned how to do this coding to create a certain pattern. During this lab, my partner
    and I messed up on the coding and realized it when we ran it. It was interesting to see how
    precise the code had to be in order for it to run perfectly.
* Lab 3
    Lab 3 part 1 had us find the pizzaria with the best deals with the use of the prices and 
    diameter of the pizzas. I liked this lab because it has us create a real life experience
    that we may want to know. By taking the prices from four pizzarias a the diameter of those
    four pizzas, we were able to create a code to calculate which one has the best deals out of
    the rest.
